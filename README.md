- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mike <@EpiDoctor>
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in infectious disease epidemiology and ecology modelling. I'm particularly interested in the ways in which interactions between wildlife, domesticated animals, and humans in anthropogenic landscapes facilitate pathogen spillover from primary reservoir hosts to novel hosts. I am currently investigating zoonoses at the wildlife-livestock-human interface in India and Australia.
